# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm
This is the basic Data Structure and Algorithm. I learned in 2020. ex) Queue, Stack, Tree, Graph etc.

Hello, I am Minjun Kang. In this directory you will find simple Data Structure and Algorithm. I tried to divide it into two respositories, but there are many cases where data structures and algorithms are simultaneously applied in one solution, so I composed it into one repository.
Also all items include reports with pseudo code, UML, and call graph.

* The file is written in Korean.

1. Fibonacci Series
* Fibonacci series is composed through two methods, Iteration and Recursion. Compare the time complexity of the two methods.

2. Prefix to postfix conversion
* The prefix to postfix operation is solved by recursion. Also drawing the call graph.

3. Decimal to Binary conversion
* This is solved by using STACK with LIFO structure.

4. 8 Queen puzzle
* Using the recursive function, configure Backtracking.

5. non generic type general linear list
* The general linked list is composed so that the text containing the year, title, and director's name can be read and input and output in a desired format.

6. ADT Queue & STACK
* The typical data structure, Stack and Queue, are composed of abstract data type. The configured function is named like InQueue and DeQueue based on Queue, but if the comment of the function that actually performs the operation is removed, it behaves like STACK.

7. ADT Heap
* The representative heap of the binary tree is composed of ADT. It satisfies the Complete Binary tree, which is the shape condition of Heap, and the node value has all <= k, which is the order condition.

8. Goal seeking
* By using the STACK ADT configured in step 6, it solves the Goal Seeking problem using the DFS algorithm. Also, it implements Undirected graph to draw Map.
